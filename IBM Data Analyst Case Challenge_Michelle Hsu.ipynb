    "There are studies showing that museums can yield positive influence on high school education. By engaging students in arts or history museum learning espericen, school can actually prevent the drop-out rate and improve the chance for students to graduate on time. Therefore, in this challenge, I want to know whether there is a postive relationship between the school's graduation rate and the number of museums in the area. Even if there exists relationship, I want to find out whether the impact is significant or not."

    "In this project, I want to test whether the number of museums and high school graduation rate have significantly positive relationship. In order to quantify the analysis, I adopted Linear Regression with Lasso Regularization due to its simplicity and generalizability. Before training the model, I standardized 'total_students' and 'Museum_count' to make sure the scale of the features is comparable. Also, I converted the categorical variables into dummy values using One-Hot Encoding. While training the Linear model, I used 10-fold cross validation to tune the hypterparameter for regularization power. The Linear Regression with Lasso Regularization ended up performing much better than the one without regularization. From the model result, the coefficient for the number of museums('Museum_count') is not 0, implying that the feature is somewhat important in predicting the high school graduation rate. To further analyze the hypothesis, I calculated the Z-score based on the coefficient and standard error of the feature, which verify the statistical significance of 'Museum_count'. Hence, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the number of museums has positive relationship with high school graduaion rate under significane level of 0.05."
